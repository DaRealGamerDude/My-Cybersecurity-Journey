# Notes

This directory serves as an index for my general learning notes that are not tied to a specific platform, lab, or challenge.

Most of my raw study notes are maintained separately as handwritten and annotated notes (created on iPad) for better flexibility while learning. These notes focus on understanding concepts, diagrams, and explanations during study sessions rather than producing polished documentation.

This folder exists to:
- reference high-level learning reflections
- link to external note collections when relevant
- avoid duplicating raw study notes across platforms

Platform-specific and applied notes (e.g., TryHackMe labs, investigations, writeups) are documented directly within their respective directories in this repository.
