# Templates

This directory contains reusable templates for documenting cybersecurity work. As someone who really appreciates consistency, these templates helps me ensure:

- standardized writeups,
- investigations are documented clearly and consistently, and
- encourage structured thinking.

These templates will evolve over time as my approach to analysis and documentation improves.
