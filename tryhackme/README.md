# TryHackMe

This directory tracks my structured learning and hands-on practice on the TryHackMe platform.

Content here includes:
- notes from learning paths and modules
- hands-on lab observations
- reflections on concepts and tools
- templates used for documenting labs and CTFs

The focus is on building strong foundations in defensive security, SOC workflows, and incident response rather than offensive exploitation.
