# Notes

This folder contains personal notes, explanations, and reflections related to cybersecurity concepts encountered during learning.

Topics may include:
- networking and protocols
- Linux and Windows internals
- security concepts and terminology
- early observations from SOC and DFIR-style analysis

These notes are intentionally informal and evolve as my understanding improves.
