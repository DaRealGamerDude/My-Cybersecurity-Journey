# Modules

This folder contains notes and summaries from TryHackMe learning modules and pathways.

These notes focus on:
- core concepts (networking, Linux, Windows security, web fundamentals)
- mental models rather than memorization
- key takeaways that are relevant to SOC and DFIR roles

This section represents structured, guided learning rather than challenge-based work.
