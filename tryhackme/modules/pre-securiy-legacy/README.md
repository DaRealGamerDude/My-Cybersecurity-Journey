# Section 2 – Network Fundamentals

---

## 🔹 What is Networking?

### Core Concepts

- IP Address
- Public vs Private IP
- MAC Address
- Router
- Switch
- Port numbers

### IP Address

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

- Private IP ranges:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0/16

Public IP addresses are routable on the internet.

---

## 🔹 Intro to LAN

### LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN connects devices within a limited area such as:

- Office
- School
- Home

Key components:

- Switches (Layer 2)
- Routers (Layer 3)
- Access points

---

## 🔹 OSI Model

7-Layer Model:

1. Physical – Cables, electrical signals  
2. Data Link – MAC addressing, frames  
3. Network – IP addressing, routing  
4. Transport – TCP/UDP, ports  
5. Session – Session management  
6. Presentation – Encryption, encoding  
7. Application – HTTP, FTP, DNS  

Security analysis often maps attacks to OSI layers.

Example:
- ARP spoofing → Layer 2  
- IP spoofing → Layer 3  
- Port scanning → Layer 4  

---

## 🔹 Packets & Frames

### Encapsulation Process

Data moves down the OSI stack and gets wrapped in headers.

Application data → TCP header → IP header → Frame header

### TCP vs UDP

TCP:
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable
- Uses handshake (3-way handshake)

UDP:
- Connectionless
- Faster
- No reliability guarantee

---

## 🔹 Extending Your Network

### Key Concepts

- NAT (Network Address Translation)
- DNS role
- Internet Service Provider (ISP)

NAT allows multiple private devices to share one public IP.

Routers connect LANs to the internet.

---

# Section 3 – How The Web Works

---

## 🔹 DNS in Detail

### DNS Purpose

Translate domain names into IP addresses.

Example:
example.com → 93.184.216.34

### DNS Record Types

- A – IPv4 address
- AAAA – IPv6 address
- MX – Mail exchange
- CNAME – Canonical name
- TXT – Text record (often used for verification or abused for exfiltration)

### Recursive vs Authoritative

Recursive resolver:
- Queries other DNS servers.

Authoritative server:
- Holds official domain records.

### TTL (Time To Live)

Determines how long DNS responses are cached.

Security relevance:
- Fast-flux malware infrastructure
- Data exfiltration via TXT records
- Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)

---

## 🔹 HTTP in Detail

### HTTP Structure

Request:

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: browser

Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

### HTTP Methods

- GET – Retrieve data
- POST – Submit data
- PUT – Update data
- DELETE – Remove data

### Status Codes

- 200 – OK
- 301/302 – Redirect
- 401 – Unauthorized
- 403 – Forbidden
- 404 – Not Found
- 500 – Internal Server Error
- 503 – Service Unavailable

### Headers

- Host
- User-Agent
- Cookie
- Set-Cookie
- Content-Type
- Content-Length

HTTP is stateless. Sessions rely on cookies.

---

## 🔹 How Websites Work

### Frontend

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Backend

- PHP
- Python
- Node.js
- Database (SQL)

### Supporting Infrastructure

- Load balancers
- CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Security exposure areas:

- Authentication logic
- Misconfigured headers
- Sensitive data exposure

---

## 🔹 Putting It All Together

Full request flow:

1. User enters domain
2. DNS resolves IP
3. TCP handshake occurs
4. HTTP request sent
5. Server processes request
6. Response returned
7. Browser renders page

Understanding this complete lifecycle is critical for analyzing web-based attacks.

7 = 4+2+1 (rwx)

---

### Ownership

`chown`

Example:

chown user:group file.txt

---

### SSH (Secure Shell)
