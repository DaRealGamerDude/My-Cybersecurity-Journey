# Labs

This directory contains hands-on exercises and small investigations completed on TryHackMe that are not full CTFs.

Labs here emphasize:
- applying concepts in controlled environments
- understanding logs, alerts, and system behavior
- learning tools gradually without time pressure

These labs serve as practice before attempting more complex CTFs or real-world scenarios.
