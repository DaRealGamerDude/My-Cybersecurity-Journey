This directory contains polished writeups documenting hands-on cybersecurity investigations, labs, and CTF-style exercises.

The focus of these writeups is not speed or flag collection, but:
- investigative reasoning
- defensive security workflows
- understanding attacker behavior and context
- reflecting on skill gaps and lessons learned

Each subfolder represents a complete, self-contained writeup intended to be readable on its own irrespective of reader's experience in the field.
